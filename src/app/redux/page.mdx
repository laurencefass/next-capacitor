# Redux with Signals demo

This demo shows how to use redux with signals

## Background: 

- React state updates trigger re-renders of entire component trees. This can be inefficient and includes redux subscriptions.
- Signals offer more efficient, granular re-renders by only updating the components that are subscribed to the signal.
- Use of Redux and Signals is not mutually exclusive. They can be used together.
- Signals can be fully integrated with redux state and mixed with non-reactive state in the store
- This component interacts with a redux slice consisting of two counters - one normal (non-reactive) state and the other a signal

## The component hierarchy looks like this:

Parent  
<Spaces count={4}/>├── Publisher  
<Spaces count={4}/>└── Subscriber  
<Spaces count={16}/>└── SubscriberChild  

## Explanation

- The random numbers will update every time a component is re-rendered.
- The Publisher dispatches redux actions to increment/decrement the counters stored in redux state.
- The Subscriber has no inputs. No props are passed instead it uses the useSelector hook to access the state directly.
- Note how incrementing the signal state does not update the child component
